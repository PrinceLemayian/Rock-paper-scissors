# Rock–Paper–Scissors

A classic implementation of the **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built to practice and solidify **JavaScript fundamentals**, DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.  
This project was developed as a hands-on exercise to build proficiency in core JavaScript concepts.

## ✨ Features

- **Classic Game Logic:** Implements the core rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- **Computer Opponent:** Computer generates a random choice each round.
- **Score Tracking:** Player and computer scores update dynamically.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Results and scores update instantly using DOM manipulation.
- **Simple & Clean Interface:** Straightforward UI focused on functionality.
- **Lightweight:** Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🧠 What I Practiced / Learned

### ✔️ DOM Manipulation

- Selecting elements with `querySelector` and `getElementById`
- Updating text content and UI elements dynamically

### ✔️ Functions & Game Logic

- Creating reusable functions for generating choices and calculating results
- Implementing conditional logic to determine each round’s winner
- Managing game state (scores, choices)

### ✔️ Event Handling

- Adding `click` listeners to player options

### ✔️ Variables & Scope

- Keeping track of player and computer scores
- Using function parameters to pass user selections
